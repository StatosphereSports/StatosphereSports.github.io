<p>Couple of interesting games this round, headlined by the big Friday Night clash between the Saints and Blues. On a more serious note, Adelaide vs Geelong and Collingwood vs West Coast are the obvious picks of the round, while the model also expects the closer game to occur at Skoda Stadium when Richmond travel interstate to take on the Giants and try and win their first game interstate of the year.</p>

<p>The difference between some predicted scores may appear to be slightly off the predicted margin by a point, this is due to rounding for display in this table.</p>
