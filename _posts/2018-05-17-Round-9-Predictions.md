<div class="blurb">

<p>This week shapes as a pretty ordinary round of footy according to SEARS. Only 2 games are predicted to be decided by under 20 points, both predicted to be deicded by less than 10 poitns.</p>
<p>
As expected West Coast vs Richmond looks the match of the round with the model potentially slightly underrating West Coast's chances due to their new home ground. GWS vs North Melbourne looks an interesting clash with both sides performing differently to what was expected by most preseason.</p>

<p>Aside from that it looks to be a mediocre weekend however, Adelaide, Port Adelaide, Geelong, Sydney and Hawthorn are all predicted to get home by over 4 goals, while the other two favourites, Collingwood and Melbourne, arent' far behind, in the 20-23 point range.</p>

<p>The difference between some predicted scores may appear to be slightly off the predicted margin by a point, this is due to rounding for display in this table.</p>
