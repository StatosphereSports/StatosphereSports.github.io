<p>Only the 6 games this round due to the byes but three predicted to be decided by under 2 goals so there should still be some good footy on offer.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise to me is the predicted result in the Geelong vs Richmond game, which is considered the match of the round by most (but not the model),  the predicted margin was larger than I expected and comes down to ground ratings, almost entirely,given how well Richmond play the G and Geelong's slightly negative rating there. It will be interesting to see how this plays out.</p>

<table border="1" class="dataframe">   <thead>     <tr style="text-align: right;">       <th>Round</th>       <th>Home</th>       <th>Away</th>       <th>Ground</th>       <th>Home Predicted Score</th>       <th>Away Predicted Score</th>       <th>Predicted Margin</th>     </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>R13</td>       <td>Port Adelaide</td>       <td>Western Bulldogs</td>       <td>Adelaide Oval</td>       <td>82</td>       <td>57</td>       <td>25</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R13</td>       <td>Sydney</td>       <td>West Coast</td>       <td>S.C.G.</td>       <td>84</td>       <td>78</td>       <td>5</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R13</td>       <td>Carlton</td>       <td>Fremantle</td>       <td>Docklands</td>       <td>77</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>-9</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R13</td>       <td>Gold Coast</td>       <td>St Kilda</td>       <td>Carrara</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>92</td>       <td>-22</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R13</td>       <td>Hawthorn</td>       <td>Adelaide</td>       <td>M.C.G.</td>       <td>89</td>       <td>79</td>       <td>10</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R13</td>       <td>Geelong</td>       <td>Richmond</td>       <td>M.C.G.</td>       <td>65</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>-20</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>

<p>The difference between some predicted scores may appear to be slightly off the predicted margin by a point, this is due to rounding for display in this table.</p>
