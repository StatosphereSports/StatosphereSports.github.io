<p>Delayed post as haven't had time to put it up before now. Obviously one game late and not a great result with that one so hopefully the rest of the round is more successful.</p>


<table border="1" class="dataframe">   <thead>     <tr style="text-align: right;">       <th>Round</th>       <th>Home</th>       <th>Away</th>       <th>Ground</th>       <th>Home Predicted Score</th>       <th>Away Predicted Score</th>       <th>Predicted Margin</th>     </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>R16</td>       <td>Sydney</td>       <td>Geelong</td>       <td>S.C.G.</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>67</td>       <td>14</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R16</td>       <td>Richmond</td>       <td>Adelaide</td>       <td>M.C.G.</td>       <td>102</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>43</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R16</td>       <td>Brisbane Lions</td>       <td>Carlton</td>       <td>Gabba</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>79</td>       <td>16</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R16</td>       <td>Port Adelaide</td>       <td>St Kilda</td>       <td>Adelaide Oval</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>66</td>       <td>29</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R16</td>       <td>Western Bulldogs</td>       <td>Hawthorn</td>       <td>Docklands</td>       <td>72</td>       <td>85</td>       <td>-14</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R16</td>       <td>Melbourne</td>       <td>Fremantle</td>       <td>Marrara Oval</td>       <td>103</td>       <td>74</td>       <td>29</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R16</td>       <td>North Melbourne</td>       <td>Gold Coast</td>       <td>Docklands</td>       <td>106</td>       <td>68</td>       <td>39</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R16</td>       <td>Essendon</td>       <td>Collingwood</td>       <td>M.C.G.</td>       <td>77</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>-13</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R16</td>       <td>West Coast</td>       <td>GW Sydney</td>       <td>Perth Stadium</td>       <td>83</td>       <td>80</td>       <td>2</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>

<p>The difference between some predicted scores may appear to be slightly off the predicted margin by a point, this is due to rounding for display in this table.</p>
