<p>After 3 tough weeks of not having a constant barrage of AFL all weeekend we're back to full strength with 9 games for the weekend. </p>
<p>The round on paper looks split in two, with 4 games that are fairly one sided and hard to see the underdog prevailing in, while the other 5 games are all predicted to be decided by 13 points or less.</p>


<table border="1" class="dataframe">   <thead>     <tr style="text-align: center;">       <th>Round</th>       <th>Home</th>       <th>Away</th>       <th>Ground</th>       <th>Home Predicted Score</th>       <th>Away Predicted Score</th>       <th>Predicted Margin</th>     </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>R15</td>       <td>Richmond</td>       <td>Sydney</td>       <td>Docklands</td>       <td>78</td>       <td>91</td>       <td>-13</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R15</td>       <td>Western Bulldogs</td>       <td>Geelong</td>       <td>Docklands</td>       <td>60</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>-34</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R15</td>       <td>Carlton</td>       <td>Port Adelaide</td>       <td>M.C.G.</td>       <td>53</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>-42</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R15</td>       <td>Adelaide</td>       <td>West Coast</td>       <td>Adelaide Oval</td>       <td>76</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>-10</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R15</td>       <td>Gold Coast</td>       <td>Collingwood</td>       <td>Carrara</td>       <td>59</td>       <td>107</td>       <td>-47</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R15</td>       <td>GW Sydney</td>       <td>Hawthorn</td>       <td>Sydney Showground</td>       <td>79</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>6</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R15</td>       <td>Melbourne</td>       <td>St Kilda</td>       <td>M.C.G.</td>       <td>107</td>       <td>76</td>       <td>31</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R15</td>       <td>Essendon</td>       <td>North Melbourne</td>       <td>Docklands</td>       <td>81</td>       <td>88</td>       <td>-6</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>R15</td>       <td>Fremantle</td>       <td>Brisbane Lions</td>       <td>Perth Stadium</td>       <td>90</td>       <td>82</td>       <td>8</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>

<p>The difference between some predicted scores may appear to be slightly off the predicted margin by a point, this is due to rounding for display in this table.</p>
