<p>The AFL at least have made up for last week's Friday night farce with what looks to be a belter of a game down at Geelong.</p>
<p>The round goes downhill from there though, with West Coast and Port Adelaide the only other game predicted to be decided by under 2 goals (admittedly I think this is underestimating West Coasts's chances due to issues with assessing thier home ground advantage at the new Perth Stadium).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on which sides show up the Bulldogs-Suns, Bombers-Hawks and Saints-Demons games have the potential to be of some interest given the inconsistencies surronuding a number of the teams involved.</p>

<p>The difference between some predicted scores may appear to be slightly off the predicted margin by a point, this is due to rounding for display in this table.</p>
