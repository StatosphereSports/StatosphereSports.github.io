<p>Shortted round this week due to the byes but there still appears to be a number of good games on offer. GWS vs Gold Coast and St Kilda and Sydney both look one sided and Fremantle vs Adelaide looks like it'll be a comfortable win for Adelaide, the other 4 games are all predicted by two goals or under though.</p>

<table border="1" class="dataframe">   <thead>     <tr style="text-align: center;">       <th>Home</th>       <th>Away</th>       <th>Ground</th>       <th>Home Predicted Score</th>       <th>Away Predicted Score</th>       <th>Predicted Margin</th>     </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Port Adelaide</td>       <td>Richmond</td>       <td>Adelaide Oval</td>       <td>73</td>       <td>83</td>       <td>-10</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Geelong</td>       <td>North Melbourne</td>       <td>Kardinia Park</td>       <td>79</td>       <td>70</td>       <td>9</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>GW Sydney</td>       <td>Gold Coast</td>       <td>Sydney Showground</td>       <td>94</td>       <td>62</td>       <td>32</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>St Kilda</td>       <td>Sydney</td>       <td>Docklands</td>       <td>64</td>       <td>100</td>       <td>-36</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Brisbane Lions</td>       <td>Essendon</td>       <td>Gabba</td>       <td>89</td>       <td>92</td>       <td>-3</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Fremantle</td>       <td>Adelaide</td>       <td>Perth Stadium</td>       <td>75</td>       <td>95</td>       <td>-21</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Melbourne</td>       <td>Collingwood</td>       <td>M.C.G.</td>       <td>98</td>       <td>86</td>       <td>12</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>

<p>The difference between some predicted scores may appear to be slightly off the predicted margin by a point, this is due to rounding for display in this table.</p>
